## Background
The relationship between obesity and poverty is constantly discussed in the context of food islands, and poor health prognosis in low income communities.  The goal of this project is to evaluate the association between poverty (independent variable)  and obseity (dependent variable), using 2014 census data.

To run this D3 visualization, open the html file. The data, js, and accompanying css files are used to prepare this analysis.

## Your Task

### Level 1: D3 Dabbler

![4-scatter](Images/4-scatter.jpg)

You need to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

Using the D3 techniques we taught you in class, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the `app.js` file of your homework directoryâ€”make sure you pull in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function. Your scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

* Note: You'll need to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
